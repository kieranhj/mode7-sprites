- Write plot routine in 6502
  What is the coordinate system - is (0,0) top left or bottom left?
 
- Including screen clipping - gah!
  Top & bottom clip doesn't matter so much - can have spare buffer memory before and after is ROM
  (Even if using RAM for music can buffer this carefully, 1k max)

  Left clip: if x<0 then width+=x sprite_offset-=x x=0 check w>0
  Right clip: if x+w>=screen then w=screen-x x can't be>screen
  ARE YOU CLIPPING IN PIXEL COORDINATES OR CHARACTER COORDINATES?!

- Test can draw at pixel accuracy and masking works etc.
- Add code generation rather than data tables
- Compare size of code vs data tables
  (Some optimisations could be had here, e.g. using INY until need to increment ptr address)
- Add ability to chop up sprite sheet (Font)
- Add scaling to sprite generation? (Depends on demo effect)
- Add rotation to sprite generation? (Depends on demo effect)
- Get a nice 32x32 font going and scrolltext
- Framework for MODE 7 demo with music from start


- Generate code to do reflections and test
- Generate code to wibble lines and test
- Star field
- Colour raster bars


w-(x+w-screen)=screen-x
